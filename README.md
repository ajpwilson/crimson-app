## 🚀 SpaceX Mission Log

[App hosted on Netlify](https://compassionate-hypatia-5aebcc.netlify.com/)

This Project was created using ```create-react-app```.

Personal React Project, originally using the Star Wars api, however being too limited I decided to use the SpaceX api.

### 🛰 Launching the app
To launch the app in a local environment, clone the repo, navigate to the root and type in the cmd line:

```npm install```

to get the required node_modules, then run:

```npm start```

This runs the app in development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

For a snappier experience, you can build the production environment:

```npm run build```

you may need to install serve (follow the instructions in the cmd line):

```npm install -g serve```

then run:

```serve -s build```

This runs the app in production mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

### 👨‍🚀 Future Work
To see what extra work I will put into the project, please view the issues tab above.

### 🔭 Reaching out for Help
I ran into an issue while working on the project, here is my post on StackOverflow: [Type error undefined issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60247043/typeerror-cannot-read-property-rocket-name-of-undefined-even-though-it-is).

### 🌖 Final thoughts
For anyone reviewing this project, please note that some launches have more details than others, so please make sure you select a few random ones (this will make more sense when looking at the app).
