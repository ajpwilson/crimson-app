## SpaceX Mission Log ðŸš€

This Project was created using ```create-react-app```.

Personal React Project, originally using the Star Wars api, however being too limited I decided to use the SpaceX api.

### Launching the app ðŸ›°

To launch the app in a local environment, clone the repo, navigate to the root and type in the cmd line:

```npm start```

This runs the app in development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
